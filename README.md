# Stock-Price-Prediction
Objective: Develop a predictive model for stock prices to assist traders, investors, and analysts in making informed investment decisions.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow

Key Tasks & Methodologies:
Imported necessary libraries for data analysis and modeling.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA):
Plotted close prices to visualize historical stock trends.
Calculated and plotted moving averages to identify trends.
Analyzed daily returns to understand stock performance.
Created correlation heatmaps to examine relationships between stock features.
Analyzed the distribution of returns to gauge risk and volatility.
Assessed stock price volatility to understand market fluctuations.

Preprocessed data for modeling:
Split data into training and testing sets for model validation.
Checked the output and consistency of training and testing datasets.
Scaled data to normalize feature values for improved model performance.
Prepared the training data for input into the model.
Developed and implemented a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:
Compiled and fitted the LSTM model using Keras and TensorFlow.
Made predictions based on the trained model.
Applied machine learning techniques to estimate future stock values using LSTM networks.

Achievements:
Developed an effective stock price prediction system with high accuracy.
Enhanced skills in data preprocessing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques.
Provided valuable insights for stock market investment decisions.
Gained proficiency in using LSTM networks for time series forecasting.
